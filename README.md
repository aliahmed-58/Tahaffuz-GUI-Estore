# Tahaffuz-GUI-Estore
This is my first year university project where I had to make a desktop application using OOP concepts in Java. It's quite simple but I learned a lot about basic data structures and OOP concepts. In addition, I got a good understanding of the Swing framework.

# To run:
Run the project jar located in dist, or just run the Homepage.java file's main method.
